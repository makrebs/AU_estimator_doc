\chapter{Batch Optimization}
\label{chap:batch}

\section{Data Selection}
... Tell how data is cut and fed into optimization routine

\section{Minimization Problem}
... Formulate minimization problem (unconstraint) as least-squares.

\section{Nonlinear Least Squares}
... Cite \cite{Seber} (Nonlinear Regression) and maybe also XXX (Linear ...)

\section{Levenberg-Marquardt Algorithm}
... Again cite \cite{Seber} or directly Levenberg or Marquardt
