\chapter{Results}
\label{chap:simulation_results}
In this chapter, the batch optimization results for the actuation configuration are shown for both simulation data and data from the real system.
A statistical analysis of the results gives some reference for the estimation accuracy.

\section{Comparing Results}
\label{sec:comparing_results}
Since the parameter space of the motor configuration is not very intuitive for error analysis,
we transform the parameter results (and their variance) to a more intuitive form such that we can compare them.
%One possibility would be to express the motor position in the Cartesian blimp frame $b$.
%But since the position of the motor on the hull has only two degrees of freedom, a representation in the three dimensional blimp frame is not that much more intuitive.
A good possibility is to express the actuation configuration in the tangential reference frames $t^k$ as introduced in \cref{sub:coordinate_systems}.
As the radius $r$ is not estimated, the estimation error in
$ \mathbf{e}_{t^k}^z $-direction is marginal.
\\
The error of the actuator arrangement is expressed by an error distance $e_{pos}^k$ for each motor $k$, which is approximated by the euclidean norm in the x-y plane of the tangential frame,
and an error angle $e_{angle}$, which is the angle between x-axes of the 'true' and estimated motor coordinate systems $\mathbf{e}_{m^k}^x$ and $\mathbf{e}_{t^k}^x$
(see \ref{fig:tangential_frame}).
\\
To express the certainty of the inertia tensor estimate, the mean of the inertia tensor properties scaled with the determinant of the inertia tensor will be used in \cref{fig:err_cmp_sim,fig:err_cmp_real}.

In any case, its $\lbrace \mathbf{e}^x_{m^k} , \mathbf{e}^y_{m^k} \rbrace$ plane will be tangential to the spherical hull such that an error of the arrangement can be approximated by the euclidean norm in the tangential coordinate frame.}

\section{Dataset Bootstrapping for Statistical Analysis}
\label{sec:bootstrapping_and_statistics}
To be able to generate meaningful results we recorded a long dataset with Skye which contains about 850 seconds of undisturbed data samples.
To improve the accuracy of statistical results bootstrapping is applied to this large dataset.
Moving block bootstrapping is applied because the dataset consists of time series data.
The block stride is selected such that the dataset is divided in about 16 blocks which
leads to the certainty that the actual standard deviation lies within 25\% the calculated standard deviation with a certainty of 95\% \citep{WikiMarginOfError}. \\
Unless otherwise stated, the presented statistical results imply an 25\% error margin.

\section{Simulation}
For the following sections, a dataset has been generated from simulation of a blimp that is similar to Skye with a \unit[1.37]{m} radius.
The simulation includes aerodynamic drag as well as sensor noise.
The dataset is \unit[850]{s} long.
The same input vectors than in the real dataset have been applied.
%includes about the same number of input vectors than a real dataset from the blimp.

\subsection{Convergence}
\label{sec:sim_convergence}
In this section we are going to discuss the convergence properties of the batch optimization.

\paragraph{Convergence w.r.t. dataset length} ~\\
In this thesis the datasets used for the batch optimization employ two metrics of length.
Individual input vectors are applied to the system for a fixed amount of time. \\
The first concept of length is thus measured in number of different input vectors, \textit{number of input vectors} for short.
The second concept of length is the amount of data-samples used during each of the different input vectors, \textit{number of samples per input vector} for short. \\
The number of input vectors is the more important length measure as will be shown later.
It determines whether the parameters are observable at all. \\
The number of samples per input vector serves mainly to reduce the effect of the sensor noise on the results. \\
\Cref{fig:result_inputlength} shows the effects of different dataset lengths.
Below about 7 different input vectors no solution could be found. 
The number of samples per input vector reduces the error because noise from the sensors is reduced.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{images/results/input_length_vs_position_error.eps}
\caption{Influence of the number of different input vectors on the mean position estimate error of the four AUs $e_{pos}$.
When using less than about 7 input vectors, no solution was found.
Number of samples per input vector decreases the error by reducing the influence of sensor noise}
\label{fig:result_inputlength}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Convergence w.r.t. initial parameter estimate} ~\\
The impact of the initial parameter estimate on the convergence of the batch optimization has been tested.
In order to test convergence, we generated a grid of initial parameters which differ from the true actuation configuration by the following two metrics:
\begin{itemize}
\item Position deviation of each actuator on the hull surface
\item Rotation angle deviation of each actuator
\end{itemize}
The algorithm first rotates the actuator around its rotation axis by the given amount and then displaces it in a random direction on the hull surface by the requested amount. \\
For a grid of different position and angle deviations the failure rate was determined with ten samples each.
\Cref{fig:result_sim_convergece_region} shows the result of this test.\\
It can be seen that an initial position offset of \textit{all} actuators in any random direction\footnote{
The simulated blimp has a hull radius of \unit[1.37]{m} and therefore the distance between two of the tetrahedrally arranged actuation units is \unit[2.62]{m}.}
is acceptable up to \unit[1]{m}.
Initial orientation offsets of the motors are acceptable up to \unit[120]{°}.
\\
The same observation can be made when using datasets from real measurements (compare \cref{fig:result_real_convergece_region}).
%Further results using real measurements are showed in the next section.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Estimation Confidence}
\paragraph{Methods} ~\\
In this thesis two methods have been used to determine  the confidence of the parameters.
The first method is outlined in section~\ref{sec:confidence_region} using the covariance matrices.
After the batch optimization has found a set of optimal parameters, the covariance matrix of the parameters is calculated by the optimization residual.
The covariance of the results is then calculated using error propagation and transformations.
We will refer to this covariance as the \textit{calculated covariance}.\\
The second method does not rely on any assumptions about covariance matrices and measures the parameter variance directly from multiple experimental results.
We will refer to this covariance as the \textit{measured covariance}.
To get enough experimental results bootstrapping as described in \cref{sec:bootstrapping_and_statistics} is used to generate 16 different datasets.

\paragraph{Confidence from covariance matrix} ~\\
As introduced in \cref{sec:sim_convergence} there are two measures of dataset length which influence the result in different ways.
The same applies to the confidence calculated from the covariance matrix.
When using multiple samples per input vector the covariance matrix gets over-confident.
This means that the calculated variance is lower than the measured variance.
It is intuitively clear, that if we apply multiple times the same input vectors, we will not get more information about the actuation configuration.
The data samples are not independent.
When using just one sample per input vector, the calculated and measured variance match.

\paragraph{Confidence from multiple results} ~\\
As outline above the variance of the parameters has also been measured by evaluating multiple datasets generated from the same system and calculating the variance for each of the parameters.\\

In \cref{fig:result_95pc_confidence} the calculated variance is compared to the measured variance.
The variances are illustrated with circles that represent the region in which the parameters reside with 95\% certainty.
The size of the circles is determined with \cref{eq:variance_to_95pc}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:variance_to_95pc}
radius = 1.96 \cdot \sqrt{variance}
\end{equation}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Estimation Performance}
\label{sub:est_perf}

To test the performance of our optimization framework, we defined five test cases.
\begin{description}
\item[Default] A simulation of a blimp that is comparable to the real Skye system. The positions of the actuation units are taken from CAD data of Skye. All 21 parameters as listed in \cref{tab:params_updated} are estimated. This is the same test case as in the previous sections.
\item[1 AU] Same blimp as in default, but only one of the AUs is estimated (AU 4). The remaining AUs are not powered at all. 12 parameters estimated.
\item[5 AU] Different blimp with 5 AUs. Configuration for all AUs estimated. 24 parameters.
\item[No Drag] Same blimp as in default, but simulation without aerodynamic drag. This is used to see how much drag influences the result accuracy.
\item[COG] Same blimp as in default, but with large additional weight at AU4 position. COG to COB offset is 10cm and yields a moment in the same magnitude as the actuation moment. This is used to estimate the error introduced by large COG shifts.
\end{description}

For each of these test cases the RMS error for 4 different parameter measures has been calculated.
The samples for the RMS calculations are generated with the same method as described in section~\ref{sec:bootstrapping_and_statistics}.
The used parameters are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Position error of AU 4 in the tangential frame
\item Angle error of AU 4 around the z axis of the tangential frame
\item COG offset error in the blimp frame
\item Inertia tensor parameter vector error in percent
\end{enumerate}

Figure~\ref{fig:err_cmp_sim} shows the results of this analysis.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=.72]{images/results/err_cmp_sim_pos.eps}
\includegraphics[scale=.72]{images/results/err_cmp_sim_angle.eps}
\includegraphics[scale=.72]{images/results/err_cmp_sim_cog.eps}
\includegraphics[scale=.72]{images/results/err_cmp_sim_tensor.eps}
\caption{Results for simulator}
\label{fig:err_cmp_sim}
\end{figure}

Here is a list of significant observations:
\begin{itemize}
\item The position estimation is accurate within centimeters
\item The angle error is lower than \unit[0.5]{°}
\item The center of gravity estimation is accurate within millimetres
\item When feeding the same number of data-points to the batch optimization, the estimation error is higher when more parameters need to be estimated (default $\leftrightarrow$ 1 AU $\leftrightarrow$ 5 AU)
\item Omitting aerodynamic drag from simulation does not improve the results by much. This supports our argumentation that we can neglect the aerodynamic effects on the rotations.
\item Although a big COG shift decreases the accuracy of the actuator positions, the COG is still very accurately estimated.
This decrease in error is not unexpected because in the parameterization of the actuator positions we assume that the actuation units are equidistant to the center of gravity.
With big COG shifts this is not the case any-more.
However, Skye would not be able to fly with such a big COG shift and thus must be tared.
When taring it is important to know the actual COG.
Following this argumentation it is not a problem that a big COG shift impacts the position estimation because the COG offset is accurately estimated even accurate if it is large.
Thus such a situation can be detected and the the COG offset reduced by moving taring weights before proceeding with estimating the actuator positions.
\item For the 1 AU case the inertia tensor error is bigger because a single actuator can excite the system only around two axes.
This yields to an estimate of the inertia tensor that is much less accurate.
\end{itemize}


\section{Experiments}
The data in this section was recorded with the Skye blimp as described in section~\ref{sec:real_system}.
For statistics, instead of calculating the RMS error we calculated the standard deviation of the results of multiple data sets.
Standard deviation was chosen over RMS error because coming up with a bias-free ground-truth is hard.
This will be discussed in more detail in section~\ref{sec:ground_truth}. \\
By using the standard deviation as a estimation performance metric we implicitly assume that the mean of all estimations lies at the true value.
With this setup it is not possible to measure estimator bias.
We will show a different performance measure in section~\ref{sub:sim_improvement} which shows that the actuator configuration from the estimation result is more accurate than the default model we used for the simulation.

\subsection{Estimation Performance}
In figure~\ref{fig:err_cmp_real} the results of the real dataset are presented.\\
It can be seen that the position estimation of the actuators is accurate to within \unit[2]{cm}.
Center of gravity estimation is also very accurate.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Simulation Improvement}
\label{sub:sim_improvement}
To test the influence of the optimized parameters on the system dynamics, one part of the dataset has been chosen for validation.
First, the same inputs as in the real dataset were used for a simulation with the actuator configuration known from CAD data of the prototype\footnote{
This information about actuator configuration is recently used on Skye system for control.}.
Second, the inputs were applied for a simulation with the optimized actuator configuration.\\
In \cref{fig:result_sim_improve_and_error}, the angular acceleration of the real dataset is compared to the two simulation cases.
During the steady state sections of the thrusters (green shaded), the error of the angular acceleration is reduced by more than a factor of two.
As the transient behaviour of the thrusters was not included in the optimization, the according parts of the simulation was not improved much.\\
Nevertheless, as the thruster dynamics is not considered in control so far, the knowledge about it would not help to increase the control performance.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.8]{images/results/compare_alpha_x.eps}
\caption{Validation section of the dataset. \textbf{Top}: Blimp angular acceleration of the real dataset (\textbf{red}), simulation with (a priori) CAD knowledge about actuation configuration (\textbf{blue}), and simulation with (adapted) optimized actuation configuration knowledge (\textbf{green}).
\textbf{Bottom}: Blimp angular acceleration difference between real dataset and the two simulation cases.
During thruster steady-state (\textbf{shaded}, the simulation error using the adapted actuation configuration (\textbf{green}) is smaller than using the a priori estimate (\textbf{blue}).
During the thruster transients (\textbf{plain}), the error of both simulations is larger.
}
\label{fig:result_sim_improve_and_error}
\end{figure}

\section{Ground Truth}
\label{sec:ground_truth}
For the experiments, the true actuator configuration is not available.
To get at least some reference values, we measured the position of the actuation units with a \textsc{Leica Viva TS15} laser tracking system.\\
The setup is shown in \cref{fig:leica_setup}.
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/leica/leica_setup.jpg}
\caption{Setup with the \textsc{Leica} tracking system. Three of the four actuation units can be seen at once. To track the relative position of all of them, the blimp was rotated such that another combination of three actuators was visible.}
\label{fig:leica_setup}
\end{figure}
With the tracking system, only three actuators can be seen at once.
To track all of the actuators, multiple measurements from different views have been made.
As a detectable feature, the center of the actuator's rotor has been used (see \cref{fig:leica_au_laser}).

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/leica/leica_au_laser.jpg}
\caption{The center of the rotor has been used for tracking.}
\label{fig:leica_au_laser}
\end{figure}

The actuator had to be rotated such that this point was visible for the current view
The resulting offset to the actuators z-axis was considered in the optimization problem,
which was formulated to calculate the distance between the actuator units.
This means, only the relative arrangement of the actuators was measured as 'ground-truth'\footnote{
The absolute configuration of the actuators with respect to the IMU (which is essential for the control) would require the precise measurement of the position and orientation of the IMU too.}.
The relative difference between the distance calculated from the \textsc{Leica} measurements and the distance calculated from our work are between 0.7 and 3.8\%.
Nevertheless, a measurement of the actuator arrangement in the geometric space is disadvantaged to an estimate found using the onboard sensors for the use in the controller because the latter ones are also used for control.
